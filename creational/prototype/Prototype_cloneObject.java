/*
  Common use cases of the prototype design pattern in web development:

    1. Cloning Complex Objects: The Prototype Pattern is useful for creating exact copies of complex objects, such as configurations or user profiles, without the overhead of constructing them from scratch.

    2. State Restoration: The Prototype Pattern can be leveraged for implementing undo/redo functionality in web applications. By keeping prototype instances that represent different states of an object, the application can easily revert to a previous state by cloning the appropriate prototype instead of reconstructing the entire object from its components.
